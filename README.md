Description
In this time of crisis when the whole world is in dismay, all one needs to do is to be aware about the seriousness of the situation and be grateful to our corona warriors who risk their life daily to ensure our safety.   In an effort to do our bit for the cause, we have made this web application to make people aware about the current state of our country and help them get easy access to some crucial information. Some key features of the app are listed below:
1. We have used API to render the latest updates on number of active cases, recovered cases and total deaths state wise.
2. Covid centres of top 5 states with their addresses and helpline numbers have been provided. Links to locate the centres on map are also provided for convenience.
3. Symptoms and precautions of the disease have been discussed in detail.
4. A dedicated section has been allotted to FAQâ€™s.
5. All webpages are completely responsive for better visibility in all devices.
6. A separate page is added to thank our corona warriors to show our utmost gratitude for their role in our lives.
